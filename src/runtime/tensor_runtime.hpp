Rationale:
 (a) The execution space consists of one or more DAGs in which
     nodes represent tensor operations and directed edges represent
     dependencies between the corresponding nodes (tensor operations).
     Each DAG is associated with a uniquely named TAProL scope.
 (b) The DAG lifecycle:
     openScope(name): Opens a new TAProL scope and creates its associated empty DAG.
                      The .submit method can then be used to append new tensor
                      operations into the current DAG. The actual execution
                      of the submitted tensor operations may start at any time
                      after submission.
     pauseScope(): Completes the actual execution of all started tensor operations in the
                   current DAG and defers the execution of the rest of the DAG for later.
     resumeScope(name): Resumes the execution of a previously paused DAG, making it current.
     closeScope(): Completes all tensor operations in the current DAG and destroys it.
 (c) submit(TensorOperation): Submits a tensor operation for (generally deferred) execution.
     sync(TensorOperation): Tests for completion of a specific tensor operation.
     sync(tensor): Tests for completion of all submitted update operations on a given tensor.
