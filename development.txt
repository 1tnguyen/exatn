BUGS:

- 32-bit integer MPI message chunking issue in the backend.

- Fix the bug(s) in the tensor order reduction mechanism in the backend.


FEATURES:

- GPU-RAM persistence:
  1. Create large tensors on GPU;
  2. Use COPY_T for smaller tensors;
  3. Cache eviction policy: Evict minimally necessary ones (prefer smaller tensors);
  4. Limit the Host buffer size to be similar to the combined devices buffer size;
  5. Introduce manual knobs to keep tensors on GPU;


- Implement tensor operator builders.


- TensorExpansion: Constructor that converts a TensorOperator
  into a TensorExpansion.


- TensorNetwork: Subnetwork replacement method:
  Contract replaced tensors, then replace the contracted
  tensor with a new tensor (sub)network.


- Introduce parallelization over tensor networks within a tensor expansion.


- Implement constrained optimization for isometric tensors.


- Tensor network bond dimension adaptivity in solvers.


- Implement parameterized non-linear optimization:
  dTensorFunctional/dParameter = dTensorFunctional/dTensor * dTensor/dParameter


- Implement conjugate gradient optimization procedure.


- Fix index slicing logic (switch to two passes):
  Pass 1: Compute the throughout volume (TH) for all indices;
          TH(index) = Sum of tensor volumes for all tensors containing the index.
  Pass 2: Slice indices with maximal throughout volume;


- Introduce DAG nodes/dependencies with multiple output operands.


- Implement the guided k-way partitioning algorithm.
